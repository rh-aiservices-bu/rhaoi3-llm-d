Water Treatment in South Africa: Systems, Strains, and a Path to Resilience
Introduction
Water in South Africa is both a lifeline and a limiting factor. The country holds roughly half the global average of freshwater per person, with a climate that oscillates between drought and deluge, and a geography where major population centers grew up far from the wettest places. Under these conditions, water treatment—spanning raw water abstraction, purification for potable supply, industrial process water, and wastewater collection and treatment—becomes a system of systems. It is also a mirror: the state of treatment infrastructure reflects broader realities in governance, finance, land use, energy security, and social equity.
This essay surveys South Africa’s water treatment landscape end-to-end. It examines the biophysical context shaping supply, the institutions responsible for quality and reliability, the technologies deployed from conventional clarification to advanced reuse, and the stressors—aging assets, load-shedding, pollution, climate variability—that push the system to the brink. It highlights regional contrasts and case studies, unpacks drinking-water and wastewater treatment trains, explores industrial and mine-water treatment, and closes with a pragmatic roadmap that pairs engineering with management reforms. Throughout, the focus is on practical detail: how plants work, why they fail, and what can realistically be done next.

1) Hydro-geographical context: scarce, variable, and uneven
Three physical facts frame South African water treatment:
Scarcity: South Africa is a water-stressed country. Mean annual precipitation averages ~450–500 mm (well below the ~860 mm global mean), with large inter-annual variability. Surface water is largely allocated; many catchments function near their yield limits in dry years. Groundwater contributes meaningfully in arid regions but is patchy in quality (salinity, nitrate, fluoride) and yield.


Spatial mismatch: The wettest areas cluster along the eastern seaboard and high Drakensberg, yet major urban-industrial hubs—Gauteng (Johannesburg–Pretoria) and the Western Cape (Cape Town)—sit in hydrologically constrained basins. This necessitated large inter-basin transfers, most famously the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) feeding the Vaal system that supplies Gauteng and parts of the Free State and North West province.


Temporal volatility: Multi-year droughts (e.g., 2015–2018 in the Western Cape) and episodic floods (e.g., KwaZulu-Natal) whipsaw supply systems. Treatment plants must deal with raw water of fluctuating turbidity, nutrients, and contamination pulses after storms—then run at low flows in dry spells, risking taste-and-odor issues and nitrification.


These fundamentals shape plant design, resilience investments, and operating procedures in ways that differ from temperate, water-abundant countries.

2) Governance and institutional architecture
Water treatment sits within a layered governance structure:
National: The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is custodian of water resources and sets drinking-water and effluent standards, allocates raw water, regulates dam safety, and oversees national monitoring programs. National water boards—Rand Water, Umgeni Water (now Umgeni–uMngeni Water after mergers), Lepelle Northern Water, Magalies Water, etc.—abstract, treat, and bulk-supply potable water to municipalities in their regions.


Provincial: Provinces have limited direct water mandates but coordinate disaster risk reduction, health oversight, and intergovernmental support.


Local: Municipalities (metropolitan, district, local) are Water Services Authorities (WSAs) and often Water Services Providers (WSPs). They run distribution networks and, in many cases, the treatment plants—particularly wastewater works. Larger metros may own/operate their own water treatment plants; elsewhere, water boards treat and sell in bulk, municipalities distribute and bill end users.


Regulatory disclosure: The Blue Drop (drinking water quality) and Green Drop (wastewater) programs evaluate performance across technical, managerial, and compliance metrics. These reveal systemic strengths and weaknesses: plants with robust process control and monitoring achieve Blue Drop certification; underperforming wastewater works face Green Drop non-compliance flags with elevated environmental risk.


Catchment management: Historically envisioned Catchment Management Agencies (CMAs) decentralize managing water resources quality and quantity; coverage has been uneven but remains a key lever to manage rivers as living systems rather than mere conveyance channels to plants.


The critical takeaway: treatment excellence depends not only on unit processes but on institutional capacity—planning, staffing, procurement, energy management, lab services, and data transparency.

3) Drinking-water treatment: process trains and operating realities
3.1 Raw water sources and quality challenges
South African plants treat from three primary sources:
Surface water: Dams and rivers (e.g., Vaal, Tugela, Umgeni, Berg–Olifants) dominate supply. Key challenges: seasonal turbidity spikes, algal blooms (taste, odor, cyanotoxins), pathogen load, and episodic chemical contamination from upstream industry or sewage bypasses after storms.


Groundwater: Boreholes supplement supply in rural towns and arid regions (Northern Cape, parts of Western and Eastern Cape). Common issues: high salinity/TDS, fluoride (dental/skeletal fluorosis risks), nitrate from agriculture/septic systems, iron and manganese.


Transfers/reuse: Inter-basin transfers stabilize supply but add complexity; blending strategies must manage variable quality. Increasingly, treated effluent and indirect potable reuse become part of the resource mix—demanding advanced treatment and vigilant risk management.


3.2 Conventional treatment train
Most large conventional plants follow a familiar sequence tailored to local raw water:
Intake & screening: Bar racks/screens remove debris; design must handle storm-driven surges.


Coagulation and rapid mixing: Dosing coagulants (often aluminium sulphate/alum or ferric salts) plus pH/alkalinity adjustment to optimize charge neutralization. Jar tests and online streaming current monitors inform dosing.


Flocculation: Gentle mixing to grow settleable flocs. Polymer aids used when raw water turbidity is low (common in dammed systems).


Sedimentation (clarification): Conventional basins, lamella plates, or pulsators settle floc. Sludge handling (gravity thickening/drying beds) is often an overlooked O&M bottleneck; improper sludge disposal can re-introduce contaminants to the environment.


Filtration: Rapid gravity sand filters (often dual-media with anthracite/sand) polish the water. Air-scour and backwash frequency rely on headloss and turbidity breakthrough; resilient plants maintain redundant filter capacity to ride through high-turbidity events.


Disinfection: Chlorination (gas or sodium hypochlorite) is standard; some plants deploy UV upstream for protozoa barrier and chloramine secondary disinfection to mitigate DBPs (disinfection by-products) and maintain longer residuals in extensive networks. Managing THMs and HAAs requires source management and optimized pre-oxidation.


Stabilization & corrosion control: Post-treatment pH/alkalinity adjustment and orthophosphate dosing may be used to control plumbosolvency and reduce red water from iron.


Storage & distribution: Reservoirs and telemetry (SCADA) orchestrate pressure zones and reservoirs in rolling topography. Long residence times—common in low-demand nights or oversized reservoirs—can cause chloramine decay and nitrification; operators use periodic super-chlorination or targeted flushing.


3.3 Advanced and alternative processes
Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF): Favored during algal blooms because buoyant flocs with microbubbles remove algae and associated organics more effectively than sedimentation.


Membrane filtration: Micro/ultrafiltration (UF) for turbidity/pathogen control; nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) for salinity, color, and micropollutants. Membrane adoption tends to cluster where surface water deteriorates or where groundwater salinity is high.


Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) and Granular Activated Carbon (GAC): For taste/odor compounds (geosmin, MIB), pesticides, and emerging contaminants. GAC biologically active filters (BAFs) provide both adsorption and biodegradation.


Ozonation/Advanced Oxidation (AOP): Selectively deployed for robust oxidation and micro-pollutant control; high capex/opex and energy intensity can be challenging under load-shedding.


Desalination: Small to medium RO plants have served coastal towns during drought; they require steady power, skilled ops, and brine management. In long droughts, emergency containerized plants bridge gaps but pose lifecycle cost questions.


3.4 Operations under energy constraints
Load-shedding (scheduled power cuts) impacts every unit process: coagulant mixers fail, clarifier sludge scrapers stop, filters cannot backwash, and chlorine dosing loses control. Resilient plants employ:
Onsite diesel generators with prioritized loads (disinfection, PLC/SCADA, critical pumps).


Variable speed drives (VSDs) and soft starts to reduce restart stress.


Resilience hydraulics: Elevated reservoirs to buffer pressure and maintain service during outages.


Process intensification: Optimized coagulant windows and filter management to maintain quality through power dips.



4) Wastewater treatment: protection for people and rivers
4.1 Why wastewater performance matters
Wastewater treatment safeguards public health, preserves environmental flows and biodiversity, and protects downstream drinking-water intakes. In South Africa, underperforming wastewater works can seed E. coli spikes, nutrient over-enrichment (algal blooms), ammonia toxicity, and emerging contaminant loads in rivers and dams relied on for potable supply. High-profile river health crises often trace back to dysfunctional wastewater works, overloaded networks with infiltration and inflow (I&I), or pump station failures during load-shedding.
4.2 Common process configurations
Primary treatment: Screens, grit removal, primary sedimentation. Many small works lack robust grit handling, leading to abrasive wear downstream.


Secondary (biological) treatment:


Activated Sludge (AS): Conventional plug-flow with return activated sludge (RAS) and waste activated sludge (WAS). Many plants use Bardenpho, UCT, or Modified Ludzack–Ettinger (MLE) configurations to achieve biological nutrient removal (BNR)—critical for phosphorus and nitrogen limits feeding eutrophic reservoirs.


Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs): Attractive for smaller towns; time-based cycles (fill, react, settle, decant) deliver BNR in a single basin set.


Trickling filters and oxidation ponds: Present in legacy/small systems; ponds require land and steady sunlight/wind.


Tertiary/advanced: Sand filters or cloth media filters for polishing; chemical P removal (ferric salts, alum) where biological P is insufficient; UV disinfection to meet microbial limits, though power reliability is an Achilles heel.


Sludge line: Thickening (DAF, gravity), stabilization (aerobic/anaerobic digestion), dewatering (belt presses, centrifuges), and reuse or disposal. Sludge logistics—hauling, regulatory approvals for beneficial use—often bottleneck compliance.


4.3 Typical challenges
Overloading and I&I: A mismatch between design capacity and actual flows; storm events can double or triple influent, bypassing treatment.


Energy and electromechanical reliability: Aeration is the biggest energy consumer; power cuts trigger biological process upsets, filamentous bulking, odor, and effluent non-compliance.


Process control: Intermittent lab testing and instrument downtime impair control of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), sludge age, and nutrient removal performance.


Skilled staffing and O&M: Vacancies and procurement delays for spares/chemicals; chlorine shortages intermittently affect final disinfection.


Industrial discharges: Without effective industrial effluent permits and pre-treatment, toxic shock loads poison activated sludge, causing plant crashes.



5) Industrial and mine-water treatment
5.1 Industrial process water
Sectors such as food & beverage, petrochemical, pulp and paper, and metals processing implement raw water pre-treatment (softening, filtration), boiler feed RO, and cooling tower cycles of concentration management. Wastewaters vary widely: high COD from food processing; color and lignin from pulp; phenols and PAHs from petrochemicals. Treatment trains combine equalization, physico-chemical (coagulation, DAF), biological (aerobic, anaerobic digestion for high-strength wastes), and polishing (RO, activated carbon). Increasingly, Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) is discussed for briny waste streams, though capex/opex are steep.
5.2 Acid mine drainage (AMD)
Decades of gold and coal mining left a legacy of acid mine drainage—low-pH, high-sulfate water rich in dissolved metals (iron, manganese, aluminum, uranium). Treatment typically involves:
High-density sludge (HDS) lime neutralization: Raising pH to precipitate metals and gypsum; clarifiers with sludge recycle create dense, settleable solids.


Metals polishing: Oxidation and filtration; sometimes specialized ion exchange for specific contaminants.


Sulfate management: Where discharge limits tighten or reuse is intended, RO or ettringite precipitation can reduce sulfate further. Disposal of brines and large volumes of gypsum sludge remains a challenge.


Prevention and active control: Mine flooding management, sealing, and source control reduce long-term loads. However, legacy voids and fractured geology make permanent fixes complex and costly.



6) Regional perspectives and case studies
6.1 Gauteng and the Vaal system
Home to ~15 million people and the economic heartland, Gauteng relies on Rand Water for bulk potable supply from the Vaal–LHWP system. Treatment plants feature robust conventional trains, high automation, and rigorous water quality monitoring. The distribution network’s scale demands careful chloramine residual management to avoid nitrification. Downstream, wastewater non-compliance in parts of the Vaal catchment has driven public concern over river health and recreation safety; catchment-wide interventions must synchronize municipal upgrades, industrial pre-treatment, and enforcement.
6.2 KwaZulu-Natal and the Umgeni system
The Umgeni/uMngeni system supplies Durban/eThekwini and Pietermaritzburg. The region faces alternating flood and drought stress, with plants periodically confronted by extreme turbidity and debris loads after storms. Midmar and related works have invested in DAF and rapid response operational protocols. Flood-damaged pump stations and trunk sewers underscore the need for resilient siting and backup power.
6.3 Western Cape and “Day Zero” lessons
The 2015–2018 drought pushed Cape Town toward catastrophic supply failure (“Day Zero”). Emergency measures included aggressive demand management, pressure reduction, groundwater wellfields, and temporary desalination contracts. For treatment, the episode validated the value of flexible source portfolios, robust risk communication, and fast-track procurement—but also revealed the complexities of temporary plants (cost, integration, and brine). Today, the Western Cape strategy emphasizes diversified sources (surface, groundwater, reuse, desalination) and advanced monitoring.
6.4 Small towns and rural schemes
Hundreds of small municipalities and village schemes face the toughest mix: limited budgets, skills shortages, aging mechanical equipment, and long supply lines for chemicals/spares. Package plants (containerized conventional or membrane systems) offer rapid deployment but require disciplined O&M and long-term funding for membranes and media replacement. Community engagement and operator training are decisive determinants of performance.

7) Drinking-water quality management: from lab to network
7.1 Monitoring programs
Routine testing spans:
Process control: Turbidity, pH, alkalinity, coagulant dose, streaming current, headloss, free/total chlorine, monochloramine, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite.


Compliance: Microbiological (E. coli, total coliforms), chemical (metals, DBPs, pesticides), radiological where relevant.


Algal/cyanotoxin surveillance: Chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin proxies, microcystins and other cyanotoxins during bloom seasons.


Distribution: Residual disinfectant mapping, HPCs, nitrification indicators, and periodic DBP sampling at extremities and maximum residence time points.


Digitalizing these datasets into dashboards (SCADA historians plus LIMS) enables predictive dosing and early warning for nitrification or taste-and-odor events.
7.2 DBP and nitrification management
DBPs increase with higher natural organic matter (NOM) and long detention times; operators adapt with enhanced coagulation, GAC filters, or moving to chloramination post-filtration with careful control of Cl₂:NH₃ ratios.


Nitrification in chloraminated systems is mitigated by: controlling free ammonia, maintaining adequate residuals, periodic free-chlorine burns, main flushing, and reservoir turnover management (baffles, mixing).



8) Wastewater compliance and river health
Green Drop assessments highlight persistent non-compliance in many works, often rooted in basics: broken aerators, non-functional return sludge pumps, lab outages, and sludge backlogs. River health indices (macroinvertebrates, fish, nutrient loads) correlate with upstream works’ stability. Pragmatic recovery plans typically combine:
Electrical/mechanical rehabilitation: Aeration blowers, SCADA, standby power, grit/screen upgrades.


Ops discipline: SOPs for MLSS control, online ammonia/DO probes, scheduled maintenance, and spares management.


Pretreatment enforcement: Industrial permits, periodic audits, sanctions for non-compliance.


Sludge logistics: Contracts for hauling and beneficial use (composting, land application meeting standards), or thermal options where volumes justify.



9) Water reuse: from indirect to direct potable
South Africa has a long history of indirect potable reuse (IPR), where highly treated effluent is discharged to rivers or dams and later abstracted for drinking-water treatment. Direct potable reuse (DPR)—pushing advanced treated effluent directly into potable systems—has moved from pilots to serious planning in several municipalities due to chronic scarcity.
9.1 Typical advanced reuse train
A robust DPR/IPR process might include:
Secondary/tertiary treated effluent as influent.


Coagulation–UF for solids, pathogen, and organics control.


RO for salts, small organics, and viruses (multi-log barrier).


Advanced oxidation (UV/H₂O₂) to degrade trace organics/micropollutants.


Stabilization and remineralization to meet corrosion control targets.


Post-treatment monitoring including online TOC, conductivity, surrogate UVT, and periodic targeted micropollutant scans.


9.2 Risk governance
DPR requires Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) frameworks, multiple independent treatment barriers, redundancy, online monitoring with automatic shutdowns, and transparent public communication. Energy intensity is material; pairing with renewable power and load-shedding-resilient designs (storage, UPS for controls) is essential.

10) Emerging contaminants and analytical frontiers
Globally, utilities grapple with PFAS, endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and microplastics. In South Africa:
PFAS data coverage is growing; removal requires GAC, ion exchange, or high-recovery RO, plus careful residual management.


Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in wastewater effluents is a rising concern; process stability and adequate disinfection reduce selective pressures.


Microplastics monitoring is nascent; conventional clarification/filtration remove many particles, but standardized detection and fate studies are limited.


Strengthening laboratory networks and inter-laboratory comparisons will underpin credible surveillance, especially as procurement cycles can disrupt consumables and standards supply.

11) Finance, tariffs, and the maintenance gap
Treatment outcomes depend on funding models:
Cost recovery: Tariffs must cover O&M, energy, chemicals, staff, and routine maintenance, with ring-fenced budgets for asset renewal. Political pressure to hold tariffs down collides with spiraling input costs (chemicals, electricity, diesel).


Capex cycles: Plants often suffer from “build-neglect-fail-rehabilitate” cycles. Long-lived civil works outlast mechanical/electrical components; lack of lifecycle planning leads to synchronized failures.


Procurement: Emergency procurement (for chemicals, spares) is common under load-shedding and supply shocks; this can improve short-term availability but raises long-term cost and quality risks. Framework contracts and vendor-agnostic equipment standards help.


Public–private models: Where municipal capacity is thin, design–build–operate (DBO) or performance-based O&M contracts can stabilize operations—if KPIs are measurable (effluent quality percent compliance, unplanned downtime, energy per ML), and oversight is competent.



12) Human capital and institutional capacity
Operators, artisans, electricians, instrumentation techs, process engineers, and lab analysts form the backbone of treatment. Persistent challenges include:
Vacancies and skills drain: Retirements and migration create gaps.


Training: Practical, plant-based training beats classroom theory. Jar testing, coagulant optimization, sludge age control, and disinfection chemistry are hands-on skills.


Competency frameworks: Linking operator grades to plant complexity and pay helps retain talent.


Safety culture: Chlorine handling, confined space entry, electrical lock-out/tag-out, and biological hazards require rigorous, audited safety programs.



13) Climate resilience and adaptation
Climate projections indicate hotter, drier interiors with more intense rainfall events along parts of the coast and escarpment. For treatment systems, resilience means:
Source diversification: Blending surface water, groundwater, reuse, and (in select cases) desalination to hedge variability.


Flood-safe siting: Elevating electrical gear, flood-proofing pump stations, and safeguarding access roads.


Drought operations: Advanced NOM management, taste-and-odor control, and pressure/demand management to stretch supplies without compromising quality.


Energy resilience: Solar PV with storage for critical controls, diesel for high-power pumps, and demand-response scheduling for backwashes and high-load operations outside peak outage windows.


Catchment restoration: Invasive alien plant removal, wetland rehabilitation, erosion control—nature-based solutions that reduce raw water variability and treatment loads.



14) Practical engineering: common failure modes and fixes
Coagulant under- or over-dosing
 Symptom: Turbidity spikes post-filters; high TOC carryover.
 Fix: Daily jar tests with seasonal dose curves; inline streaming current feedback; ensure pH/alkalinity within coagulant’s optimal window.


Filter breakthrough and mudballs
 Symptom: Rising turbidity at start of run; uneven headloss.
 Fix: Air-scour calibration; inspect underdrains; media leveling; ensure adequate backwash rates with energy-resilient pumps.


DBP exceedances
 Symptom: THMs/HAA5 above limits in distal network.
 Fix: Enhanced coagulation/GAC; switch to chloramine post-filtration; reduce detention time via reservoir baffles and operational setpoints.


Nitrification episodes
 Symptom: Falling chloramine residuals; nitrite detected; taste complaints.
 Fix: Free-chlorine burn; control free ammonia; reservoir mixing; main flushing plan.


Wastewater bulking/foaming
 Symptom: Poor settling, high effluent TSS.
 Fix: Adjust F/M and SRT; ensure adequate DO; address nutrient balance; selective wasting; filament control.


Sludge handling bottlenecks
 Symptom: Backups causing poor clarification.
 Fix: Dewatering rehab; reliable polymer supply; contracts for disposal/beneficial use; contingency drying beds.


Power instability
 Symptom: Process upsets, missed backwashes, chlorine pump trips.
 Fix: Generator sizing and fuel management; UPS for PLCs/scales; prioritize essential loads; schedule backwashes to outage-free windows.



15) Digital transformation: data to decisions
Smart monitoring can be a force multiplier:
SCADA with alarm rationalization: Reduce nuisance alarms; focus on critical limits (turbidity, residuals, DO).


Online analyzers: Streaming current, UV254, online TOC, ammonia, nitrate, phosphate; DO and ammonia in aeration basins.


Predictive maintenance: Vibration and temperature sensors on blowers/pumps; bearing failure prediction.


Hydraulic modeling and District Metered Areas (DMAs): Leak detection, pressure management, and residence time control reduce non-revenue water and DBP risks.


Digital twins: Simulate coagulant response to NOM changes or aeration strategies to meet ammonia targets at lower energy.


Implementation must match capacity; simpler dashboards that actually guide action beat sophisticated platforms that gather dust.

16) Equity and the service gap
Universal safe water and sanitation remain constitutional rights. Yet service disparities persist:
Rural households may rely on communal standpipes or yard taps with intermittent supply; water safety plans must extend to these systems.


Informal settlements often connect via temporary or illegal connections; pressure/quality control suffers.


Tariff structures must protect indigent households while recovering costs from those able to pay, avoiding perverse incentives that starve O&M.


Community health outcomes—diarrheal disease, skin conditions, and broader wellbeing—track the reliability of water and wastewater services. Treatment excellence is therefore a public health intervention, not merely an engineering task.

17) Roadmap: ten actionable priorities
Stabilize power for water
 Ring-fence funding for generators, fuel, and critical UPS; standardize load-prioritization playbooks; co-site solar plus storage for controls and low-lift pumps.


Rehabilitate the basics
 Focus first on unit processes that unlock compliance: screens, grit removal, aeration blowers, return sludge pumps, filter underdrains, chemical dosing skids.


Restore monitoring credibility
 Recommission laboratories and online analyzers; enforce sampling plans; publish monthly quality dashboards to rebuild public trust and operator pride.


Protect source waters
 Enforce industrial discharges; repair sewer pump stations; invest in catchment restoration that lowers treatment burden and risk.


Scale targeted reuse
 Accelerate IPR where dams already receive effluent; pursue DPR only with robust multi-barrier trains, energy plans, and transparent risk communication.


Professionalize O&M
 Use performance-based contracts or shared services where local capacity is thin; codify SOPs; ensure spares/chemicals via framework contracts.


Close the sludge gap
 Fund dewatering and reliable off-take; pilot regional sludge hubs for composting or energy recovery where volumes allow.


Invest in human capital
 Apprenticeships for artisans; operator certification linked to pay; plant-level coaching on jar tests, SRT control, and disinfection chemistry.


Plan with realistic asset lives
 Adopt rolling 10–15 year asset management plans; replace electrical/mechanical components on schedule; avoid synchronized end-of-life failures.


Design for climate swings
 Flood-safe siting, reservoir baffling, mixing, and flexible blending; modular add-ons (DAF, GAC) for episodic raw water deterioration.



18) Conclusion
South Africa’s water treatment story is one of ingenuity under constraint. Inter-basin transfers knit together a hydro-economy that otherwise wouldn’t function. Utilities have deployed an array of treatment technologies—from conventional floc-sed-filter trains to UF/RO and AOP—while wrestling with droughts, floods, and energy shortfalls. Yet the system’s weakest links are as much managerial as mechanical: maintenance backlogs, skills gaps, fragile monitoring, and erratic power cascade into quality failures.
The path forward is clear and achievable: secure power for critical processes; fix the fundamentals of screening, aeration, filtration, and disinfection; rebuild labs and data; hold the line on industrial pre-treatment; expand reuse where risks can be managed; invest in people; and plan assets across their true life cycles. Done together, these moves build resilience—so that when the next drought hits or the next storm surges, taps still flow with safe water and rivers still run clean.
Water treatment is not only about meeting a standard; it is about enabling economic activity, protecting ecosystems, and affirming dignity. In South Africa, that work is urgent, possible, and worth doing extraordinarily well.
